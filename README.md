# Plant-disease-detection-using-efficienetB3
Built a deep learning-based plant disease classification system using EfficientNet-B3, trained on the PlantVillage dataset. Applied advanced image preprocessing techniques like CLAHE, denoising, and sharpening to improve visual clarity and model accuracy. The model achieved 94.8% accuracy, outperforming baseline CNNs.
